                Around two years ago when I was still in college or just left college, I cant remember. a friend ended up messaging me and asked me if I could borrow my mums credit card, which I said no do, then I told my mum who told my friends mum so my friend got in pretty big trough I believe  when someone places trust in me to do(or not do something In this situation) that I should uphold it, unless its something that puts a lot of strain on me, which not telling someone credit card numbers will do.  I suppose valuing a friend and trying to help them is a possible decision but ive found that losing someone that you care about's trust hurts and does more harm in than the possible benefit of helping someone by betraying someone that trust you. I also value not stealing as its not fair to the person who's stolen, and im not sure if my friend would've ever returned the money if I gave him the credit card, so that went into my decision process.

                Not giving my friend my mums credit card was an easy decsion to make, I didnt even have to really think about it. Weighing my values in my head I knew that there would be a net large negative on both myself and my mum if I was to do it. Another thing altogether though was me deciding to tell my mum. I ended up telling my mum because of the potential to make my friend a better person and I guess give him a wakeup call. I try to reduce harm wherever I can if its easy for me and in this situation it was. Of course there was a bit of a little bit of animosity between us a little while but we ended up still being friends after and as far as im aware he hasnt done something similar since.

            <h5 class="head">Some strengths and weaknesses</h5>
            <p class="par">
              I feel like due to the place I feel like a big one is as new zealand is a developed country it has a higher respect and regard for women than some other countries for example some countries in the middle east where women are treated legal and socially lessee than men.  New Zealand was the first country to give women the right to vote and and was one of the first countries to give full legal rights to women so in recent years its been up there in regards to treatment of women a. Of couse there is still a fair ways to go in regards to social equality. ie in harassment of women and general derogetory and lesser portrayals of women in the media. But due to my exposure of strong female role models and because I grew up with my mum and my sister I believe that I value women on the same level as I do men and treating as humans equal to men is important to me.

              In the same vein also because I grew up in A nice country I am also very accepting of gay people. Because in my life growing up adults treated gay people like normal people I do too. Also as i grew up and was also asking questions I came to the conclusion that there is nothing inherantly wrong about being gay. And because I know gay people and because my sister is gay, ive been around enough gay people to accept them . And as I mentioned earlier because there is not horrible anti gay bias in nz the media reflects this, meaning I wasn't socially influenced to dislike gay people.

                <p class="str">Strengths</p>
                <ul class="par">
                  <li>values learning new ideas: I really like gaining new information as having more information improves my like and work in all facets. So when I have easy access to new and interesting information I learn quickly. This helps me learning in that I can learn quickly when given the right information and when I am learning something I really enjoy I learn it quickly.</li>
                  <li>Caring of other people: I would consider myself A caring person and like making people happy. This also comes with empathy in that I understand peoples viewpoints and am okay with incorperating them into a bigger picture. This helps with being able to solve problems tasked to me as im able to better understand the needs of the person giving the problem.</li>

                <p class="str">Weaknesses</p>
                <ul class="par">
                  <li>Perfectionist: This one is more of a nertral quality, but when working on projects i either want to do as best as possible, and if I cant do that I just do it at a mediocre level. I know with most things I could do them well with enough time and learning, but if I can't I shut down a bit and do the easiest way, but not neccessarily the best.</li>
                  <li>Gets stressed over time: The more time I spend on something the more I get stressed I like to get things done relatively quickly and just get wound up and stressed the more time I spend on something, More specifically spending  a lot of time on something that im struggling with and not getting the answer really. I feel like this means that I am much more efficient at working on things that I know and can spend longer on projects when I understand what im doing.</li>
                  <li>Tiredness: I'm not sure why, but my sleep can often be very erratic and depending on what im doing I can get tired very easily, making it hard for me to focus. I often need to get energy drinks when im working on something so I can continue to get focus. This can be a problem sometimes when later or earlier in the day I can have slow productivity.</li>

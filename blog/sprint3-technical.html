      <p class="head">The differences between HTML and CSS</p>
      <p class="par">
        HTML on its own is effectively the content of the webpage, such as text and images. If one were to display
        solely the HTML on a web page it would just display the content from the HTML in the order it was written, with
        a default font, default spacing between lines, words and paragraphs, default font size and default font styling
        such as colour and no extra styling such as underlining. It would effectively just look like a plain piece of
        paper with writing and images in the order that its written. For this to change a website also has to
        incorporate CSS, or cascading style sheet. CSS doesn't display anything on its own, but CSS can be used to
        specify specific parts(called elements) of HTML, such as a paragraph, image or heading, and add specific styling
        to the HTML. For example the second paragraph on a web page, using CSS, could be changed to have red text, have
        a font size of 40 pixels, and have a dotted blue border around it.CSS can also be used to set the positioning of
        an element of a page, such as set an image 30% of the way from the left side of the screen. This is just a brief
        overview of CSS and it can so a lot more.

      <P class="head">What is control flow and looping? </p>
      <p class="par">
        Control flow uses specific statements such as if and for, to execute instructions in a specific way rather than
        executing instructions purely from top to bottom. An example of instructions with bad/little flow control would
        be. my example of unloading groceries after going shopping. One could, while writing instructions on how to do
        it, could write “check first bag look at the item on the top go put it in fridge, then return and look at the
        second item go put it in the fridge ...” until they've written an instruction to look at every item in every
        bag, pick it up, then put it in the fridge. This would be inefficient for a number of reasons. Firstly writing
        out all those instructions is silly when it can be shortened to something shorter. Secondly, picking up the
        first item in a bag the putting it away is very inefficient, It would be much more efficient if similar items
        were picked up together and put away together, saving the amount of trips taken. Thirdly, this set of
        instructions doesn't specify what to do with a specific item, meaning everything just goes in the fridge. A new
        set of instructions can be made using flow control and loops to make the process more efficient and logical. An
        example of this could be : “Firstly check the top item of the first bag. If there are items of a similar
        category to the top item in the bag pick them up, otherwise just pick up the top item. Then check whether the
        top items category needs to go in the fridge. If it does then put it in the fridge. Repeat process for all held
        items until they are stored. Then do the same checking process for all the items in the first bag, then just
        follow the same process used for checking the first bag for the rest of the bags till everything is put away.”
        this uses control statement to follow the instructions in a specific way. For example, it uses control flow to
        only put items in a fridge if they are meant to go in a fridge, instead of putting all items in the fridge. The
        instructions also use loops to repeat instructions again without having to write them repeatedly. In this
        example the instructions on how to empty a shopping bag is looped instead of written multiple times.

      <p class="head">What is the DOM and how would someone interact with it?</p>
      <p class="par">
        The DOM or document object model is a logical hierarchical tree like structure that is used by your browser to
        specify in what way the browser should interpret HTML CSS and JavaScript. The DOM is an important part of a
        website as it give a logical structure for programmers to be able to use. Here is a visual representation of it.
      </p>
      <img id="dia" src="../styles/img/dom.png" alt="Document Object Model Diagram">
      <p class="par">
        In the image above, the top part (called node) of the DOM is called the document, The DOM can be manipulated in
        various ways such as <code>getElementById('id')</code> which gets a specific element from the document with a
        specific id, or <code>getElementsByClassName('class')</code>, which returns an array of Elements from the
        document with a
        specific class associated with them.

      <p class="head">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p>
      <p class="par">
        Accessing data from arrays versus objects is quite different. As arrays are effectively list of objects you
        would access them by doing:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code id="code1">
          var arr['dog', 'cat', 'spider']
          var a = arr[1]

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="par"> This would make the variable <code>a</code> equal the second item in the array <code>arr</code>
        keep note that the
        first item in an array is considered the 0th item when trying to find it and the second item in an array is
        considered the 1st item, because code is computery like that.</p>
      <p class="par">An object is effectively a list of properties and their values. For example:</p>
      <pre>
        <code id="code1">
          var man = {firstName:'joe', lastName:'billingsly', gender:'male', arms:5, hairColor:'blonde'}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="par">Would create an object where the property <code>hairColor</code> would equal <code>blonde</code>. Objects can be accessed in
        specific ways. One example of this would be:</p>
      <code>var name = man.firstName</code>
      <p class="par">would make a variable to the property of <code>firstName</code> in the <code>man</code> object.</p>
      <p class="head">What are functions and why are they useful.</p>
      <p class="par">
        Functions are reusable parts of code that allows a programmer to repeatedly use a piece of code without having
        to rewrite code constantly. It also allows a programmer to easily identify problems with code by looking at the
        code in the function specifically. An example function would be:

      </p>
      <pre>
          <code id="code1">
            function displayTotals (totals) {
              for (var key in totals) {
                document.getElementById(key + '-total').innerHTML = totals[key]
              }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p class="par"> So instead of having to type out all the code in between the curly brackets every time a
        programmer wanted to add two numbers together the programmer could just type <code>quikmath(a,b)</code> with
        <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> being
        two numbers and the code would be executed.</p>

      <h3 class="head">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="par">
        My long term goal is to develop the skills to be able to make a living though coding/web development, and
        eventually possibly use those skills to be able to work overseas.
      </p>
      <h4 class="head">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at
        EDA? </h4>
      <p class="par">I would like to see myself develop perseverance to be able to commit time to something for long periods of
        time. also, to be able to talk to people I don't know better.</p>

      <h5 class="head">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
      <p class="par"> I like to know and understand information so when I can get interesting information about something I will try
        to, but I spend too long on something I start to struggle and my productivity slows.

      </p>
      <h6 class="head">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
        programme. This
        should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
        learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h6>
      <p class="par">
        I will be nice to my fellow learners as well as the facilitators and other people that will be at the course. I
        will also ask for help when I need it. I will focus periods of time to get the work done and will have breaks to
        refresh the mind at regular intervals. I will also go to be at reasonable times as to get a good amount of
        sleep. I will also go over problems again formulaic if I don't understand them.

      </p>

      <h7 class="head">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h7>
      <p class="par">
        I will seek help by going and finding a member of my cohort and asking them for help by telling them the problem
        I have. If we both don't know ill ask another member or I will approach A facilitator for help.
      </p>
      <h8 class="head">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h8>
      <p class="par">
        I expect the facilitators to guide me on the correct learning path to be able to learn the skills to be a web
        developer. I also expect the facilitators to assist me with any problems I have, but give me the opportunity to
        solve the problems on my own without the facilitator spoon-feeding me the answers.
      </p>
      <h9 class="head">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
        example, you
        might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h9>
      <p class="par">
        I don't have any scheduling conflicts that will get in the way of EDA.

      </p>

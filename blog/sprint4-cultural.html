      <p class="head">How does understanding the priciples of neuroplasticity benefit people?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity have many benefits to a person. One benefit is just knowing
        about the principles of neuroplasticity allows people to remove mental barriers that a person may have put up
        that was stopping them from doing things. For example, many people coming from a fixed mindset not knowing the
        principles of neuroplasticity may view a skill, such as painting, as impossible for them to achieve, or that
        they will never reach the heights as skilled artists, because they don't have intrinsic talent that skilled
        artists have. Whereas understanding the princibles of neuroplasticity, more speficically the fact that the mind
        is not fixed on what it can do and that it can adapt and change depending on the situation, means that a person
        can lower these mental barriers and actually attempt and learn things that they wouldn't have initially. Another
        benefit to knowing the principles of neuroplasciticy is that by knowing these principles, one can actively
        attempt to manipulate the ideas of principles to their advantage..

      </p>
      <P class="head">How could one engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for their own benefit? </p>
      <p class="par">
        The way one should engage with neuroplasticity is quite similar to the above stuff. If one can go and do things
        that they hadn't done before or consistently do things, they can make and reinforce neural pathway in the brain.
        Also by realizing that doing things consistently helps reinforce ideas in the brain, one can make a plan to do
        things regularly to like for example regularly practicing coding to reinforce those concepts in the brain.
        Another way one could engage with neuroplasticity is that while learning concepts, linking different concepts to
        others with things like mnemonics can help reinforce both those concepts.

      </p>
      <p class="head">What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity</p>
      <p class="par">
        There are many ways for someone to increase their neuroplasticity. Generally just doing things that require
        using your brain(so most things) will increase ones neuroplasticity, but certain things help increase those
        connections in the brain more than others. Some examples of this are traveling or, to make new connections and
        ideas in the brain, or reading, which helps gain and reinforce ideas. Or doing things like sleeping or art
        reinforces pathway while at rest.
      </p>
      <p class="head">What is the Growth mindset and why is it relevant?</p>
      <p class="par">
        The growth mindset is the mindset that a person can achieve anything/have nearly unlimited growth potential, if
        they dedicate a sufficient amount of their mind and time to an action/concept. This is the opposite to the
        common fixed mindset in which people are fixed/limited in what they can potentially achieve due to the genetics
        that they are born with.
      </p>
      <p class="head">Did anything suprise or change for me in this exploration?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Honestly not much really surprised me or changed for me in this exploration. Although my mindset before I did
        this exploration was similar to the growth mindset in that I understood that I could do a lot of things with
        sufficient time/dedication with a specific idea or action. I never really believed that I was fixed in what I
        could or couldn't do in the first place. Doing this exploration didn't really change how I perceive things and I
        didn't come to a big realization, but it did make me think and consider that I should be spending more time on
        learning things that I care about.
      </p>
      <p class="head">How will I integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey?</p>
      <p class="par">
        I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by consistently revising and reviewing concepts that
        I learn, as well as just generally reflecting on what I have done to reinforce it into my head.

      <p class="head">A time I got blocked on a simple problem.</p>
      <p class="par">
        One simple problem that seemed to happen to me often in code was error messages about the wrong placement of
        brackets. Often times error messages would come up about the placement of brackets and I'd be stumped. I would
        review my code and everything would look okay but it would still be wrong. To solve this I would look at the
        error messages and see what bracket it would suggest and often that would actually solve the problem, but
        sometimes its answer would be too confusing to solve. So I would google the problem to see situations similar to
        mine and that would sometimes solve the problem. But the best way I found the problem was to go line by line and
        carefully read the code to find the problem. Often it would just be that I forgot to use an equals sign and I'd
        end up feeling relieved that its from a problem that I can easily solve and understand.

      </p>
      <P class="head">A time I solved a problem in an elegant way. </p>
      <p class="par">
        On the repl fizzbuzz challenge I had a problem where it would initially change a value to fizz if it was a
        multiple of 3, but it wouldn't change it again to fizzbuzz if it was a multiple of 15. To try to solve this I
        firstly went and reread my code to see if there were any mistakes, then because I couldn't see any clear ones I
        ended up doing more research about the modulus (%) operator to see if I was using it wrong. I tested using the
        modulus operator in other situations and I seemed to be using it correctly, so I didn't know what was wrong. I
        never ended up figuring out why it didn't work, but after reviewing my code I realized that if something is a
        multiple of 3 and 5, then it also must be a multiple of 15, meaning I could change my code to make it only
        change the numbers to a string once, instead of changing if a number is a multiple of 5, then changing again if
        it's a multiple of 15. By doing this and changing it so it checks for the highest number multiple first, in this
        case 15 ended up simplifying the code and decreasing the amount of actions the code would have to do. I guess I
        learnt that I should try to look at other ways to solve a problem, because often there might be a more elegant
        way to solve it.

      <p class="head">Reflection on problem solving processes.</p>
      <ul class="par">
        <li><b>Pseudocode:</b> I feel like I am confident at using pseudocode, I just haven't got into the habit of
          writing it yet. For most of the problems I have in my head I'll be more eager to actually start coding the
          solution than to write pseudocode, especially if the problem seems easy. Though by not writing pseudocode I've
          probably caused problems that could've been fixed by writing pseudocode. I'd like to use more pseudocode in
          the future, especially on tougher projects.</li>

        <li><b>Trying something: </b>I am very confident at trying something. This is how I solve most of my problems
          and how I've solved most of my problems for ages.</li>

        <li><b>The Rubber ducky method: </b>I am mildly confident at using the rubber ducky method. Although it was not
          exactly a rubber ducky, I ended up explaining how I would solve a few problems in the kata challenges to a
          friend while we were gaming and that helped me to understand the problems better. I should try doing this more
          by myself though.</li>

        <li><b>Reading error messages: </b>I feel like I am quite confident at reading most error messages. Some are too
          technical for me to understand but some are written exactly how they should be for me to easily solve a
          problem.</li>

        <li><b>Console.logging: </b>I am very confident at console.logging. I used this often to check what my code was
          actually doing and doing this allowed me to identify locations where problems were going wrong very easily, so
          I could solve the problem.</li>

        <li><b>Googling: </b>I am also very good at googling. I do this often too and it is an easy way to find
          solutions to problems, as someone probably has had the same problem as me.
        </li>

        <li><b>Asking my peers for help:</b>I am not exactly confident at asking peers for help because I feel like it
          would generally take longer to ask someone, then wait for their response, than for me to be able to solve the
          problem myself. Though when at bootcamp and when I am seriously stumped I would like to get into the habit of
          doing this more as having people explain something in a way I can understand would be helpful, and getting
          pairs to help would also assist in them reinforcing concepts in their mind too.
        </li>

        <li><b>Asking coaches for help: </b>The same as above really, but it's their job to do it, so I should be doing
          it more.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Improving processes with reflection: </b>I am pretty confident at improving with reflection, but
          oftentimes I don't do it though writing down things, ill instead reflect by thinking about problems I've
          solved throughout the day, but maybe I should reflect by writing more.</li>

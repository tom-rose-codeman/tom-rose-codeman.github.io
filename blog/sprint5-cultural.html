        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
        learning?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        One thing that I learnt about myself is that I still have a lot to unpack in my mind to be able to truly
        understand myself. While trying to do these core exercises and thinking it really took a lot of thing and
        delving deep into my mind to be able to come up with answers and conclusions to questions. There is really a lot
        of experiences and information in my head and for me to be able to have a truer understanding of myself ill have
        to spend more time thinking and reflecting.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I also have learnt that spending enough consistent time on something, makes thing eventually seem easy and
        understandable. For example as I wrote the core blogs I had an easier and easier time writing them, maybe
        because I had gotten better at reflecting about myself allowing me to write my ideas down easier.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I also learnt about better time management skills. Seeing as it had been awhile since I had to manage my time in
        this way, I had to learn how to manage my time and split up task in a way where things wouldn't end up extremely
        daunting, but using the core learning I did feel like I got better at processing information and task allowing
        me to manage them more easily.
      </p>


      <P class="head">
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I think the role of values in programming is an important one because it allows us to be able to understand our
        strengths and weaknesses, and knowing and exemplifying values that allow us to work at our best as well as
        understanding how those values might drive us into situations that cause us to fall into maladaptive practices
        so we can best mitigate them.also being able to understand the values such as fellow employees and clients,
        helps to understand their needs allowing us to work together with them in a better way.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Having empathy is also important for similar reasons to the above. Having empathy helps us to understand and
        work better with fellow programmers so they can work at their best and to understand customers so we can
        understand their needs to be able to program something to solve their problem.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Having self awareness is important too , because it allows one to understand their limits, so one knows when
        they are pushing themselves too much and need a break and when they are being too lazy and need to put in more
        effort.
      </p>
      <p class="head">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        What surprised my in core learning is that sometimes it was really easy for me to write a lot and that often I
        could just write a whole bunch about myself in a short period of time>. Usually it is hard for me to write a lot
        but I think that some of the ideas that I expressed in core were very clear to me.
      </p>
      <p class="head">
        What were the most challenging aspects of core learning.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Really the most challenging aspect of core learning for me was the writing part. Trying to write out my
        thoughts, especially to fit a specific criteria, can often be really challenging for me. I spend a lot of time
        too reviewing what I have written to make sure it is correct or that I have written enough and that can be
        annoying. Also I didn't really find it as engaging as the coding side of things as that was
      </p>
      <p class="head">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in
        a web development bootcamp course?</p>
      <p class="par">
        I think EDA, as a programming school, spends so much time on core learning because having this core knowledge
        and reflection in our heads allows us to work and mesh better with other people, increasing our chances to land
        jobs and allowing us to increase our relationships with other people. Also in general having a good mindset and
        habits allows us to work better in general, so having these skills just makes us better at working, and just
        improves all aspects of life.
      </p>
      <p class="head">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Overall the time spent studying core I don't think was a waste of time, in that I actively improved as a person
        while doing the core learning and that core learning will be helpful for me now and later on in boot camp and
        beyond. Maybe for me though if I had spend more time actively learning more coding concepts and ideas I would've
        gotten more immediate, clear and useful information for me to be able to use now and in bootcamp. But only time
        will tell really. Maybe ill reflect on what I'd learnt in core in the future and realize it had a tangible
        positive effect on the way I think and act.

      <h2>Cultural 5 - reflection </h2>
      <p class="head">
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
        learning?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        One thing that I learnt about myself is that I still have a lot to unpack in my mind to be able to truly
        understand myself. While trying to do these core exercises and thinking it really took a lot of thing and
        delving deep into my mind to be able to come up with answers and conclusions to questions. There is really a lot
        of experiences and information in my head and for me to be able to have a truer understanding of myself ill have
        to spend more time thinking and reflecting.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I also have learnt that spending enough consistent time on something, makes thing eventually seem easy and
        understandable. For example as I wrote the core blogs I had an easier and easier time writing them, maybe
        because I had gotten better at reflecting about myself allowing me to write my ideas down easier.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I also learnt about better time management skills. Seeing as it had been awhile since I had to manage my time in
        this way, I had to learn how to manage my time and split up task in a way where things wouldn't end up extremely
        daunting, but using the core learning I did feel like I got better at processing information and task allowing
        me to manage them more easily.
      </p>


      <P class="head">
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I think the role of values in programming is an important one because it allows us to be able to understand our
        strengths and weaknesses, and knowing and exemplifying values that allow us to work at our best as well as
        understanding how those values might drive us into situations that cause us to fall into maladaptive practices
        so we can best mitigate them.also being able to understand the values such as fellow employees and clients,
        helps to understand their needs allowing us to work together with them in a better way.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Having empathy is also important for similar reasons to the above. Having empathy helps us to understand and
        work better with fellow programmers so they can work at their best and to understand customers so we can
        understand their needs to be able to program something to solve their problem.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Having self awareness is important too , because it allows one to understand their limits, so one knows when
        they are pushing themselves too much and need a break and when they are being too lazy and need to put in more
        effort.
      </p>
      <p class="head">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        What surprised my in core learning is that sometimes it was really easy for me to write a lot and that often I
        could just write a whole bunch about myself in a short period of time>. Usually it is hard for me to write a lot
        but I think that some of the ideas that I expressed in core were very clear to me.
      </p>
      <p class="head">
        What were the most challenging aspects of core learning.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Really the most challenging aspect of core learning for me was the writing part. Trying to write out my
        thoughts, especially to fit a specific criteria, can often be really challenging for me. I spend a lot of time
        too reviewing what I have written to make sure it is correct or that I have written enough and that can be
        annoying. Also I didn't really find it as engaging as the coding side of things as that was
      </p>
      <p class="head">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in
        a web development bootcamp course?</p>
      <p class="par">
        I think EDA, as a programming school, spends so much time on core learning because having this core knowledge
        and reflection in our heads allows us to work and mesh better with other people, increasing our chances to land
        jobs and allowing us to increase our relationships with other people. Also in general having a good mindset and
        habits allows us to work better in general, so having these skills just makes us better at working, and just
        improves all aspects of life.
      </p>
      <p class="head">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Overall the time spent studying core I don't think was a waste of time, in that I actively improved as a person
        while doing the core learning and that core learning will be helpful for me now and later on in boot camp and
        beyond. Maybe for me though if I had spend more time actively learning more coding concepts and ideas I would've
        gotten more immediate, clear and useful information for me to be able to use now and in bootcamp. But only time
        will tell really. Maybe ill reflect on what I'd learnt in core in the future and realize it had a tangible
        positive effect on the way I think and act.
      </p>
      <h3>Preparing for bootcamp</h3>
      <p class="head">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
      <p class="par">
        My long term goal would be eventually to get a job being a developer or to be able to make a living being a
        developer, and to be able to gain the skills necessary to be able to develop applications for myself and others.
        I think I would like to use this to grow my skills too, so I can use these skills in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="head">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>
      <p class="par">
        I think my strengths and weaknesses are pretty much the same as before. I think a big strength of mine is the
        desire to gain more information, and when I have the opportunity to gain more information that can be quickly
        reinforced into my brain especially when gaining that new information bears fruit in terms of solutions to
        problems. Another weakness of mine is when things frustrate me for a long period I tend to slow down in
        productivity and try for the easiest method of success, conversely when I find something easy to understand or
        challenging in a good way or I try to build on that knowledge and produce something better that what I would do
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="head">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>
      <p class="par">
        I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be staying motivated over the full nine weeks of bootcamp. I
        think initially I will be fine, but as time goes on all the effort I'm putting in might start to drain on me. I
        think an important part of bootcamp to try to mitigate this will be to be engaged the whole way though so my
        brain doesn't get strain out of repetition or boredom.
      </p>
      <p class="head">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at
        EDA?</p>
      <p class="par">
        The skills that I would like to see developed in myself in EDA I feel are largely the same as last time.I would
        like to be able to develop good habits that allow me to persevere with things, even if I don't like them, for a
        long time, so I can achieve useful goals that I set myself. I'd also like to be able to develop better speaking
        skills so that I can open up and talk to new people using a better mindset.
      </p>
      <p class="head">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
      <p class="par">
        Because I am not exactly sure what bootcamp entails and what the average day will be like, I don't know exactly
        what till be like but some things are as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        I will try to balance my time by allowing myself free time to relax after every day at bootcamp. I will also try
        to manage my sleep by going to bed and getting up at good times, so I'm not tired while at bootcamp. I will also
        try to take advantage of my peers and the facilitators as much as possible if in confused or stuck on a problem,
        so I can gain adequate knowledge to be able to solve said problem or others. I will also do my best to put my
        mind in full concentration mode to I can absorb as much information as possible and not struggle on things due
        to not paying attention. I will also not be an asshole, so I can have good relations with my peers, as this is
        important.

      <h2>Cultural 3 - Emotional intelligence.</h2>
      
      <p class="head">What is emotional intelligence?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to observe understand and control ones and other peoples emotions and
        thoughts. This allows for being more confident, happy, empathetic and productive.

      </p>
      <P class="head">What is the difference between emotional intelligence and IQ? </p>
      <p class="par">
        Emotional intelligence is different to EQ as emotional intelligence is what is described above, whereas EQ, or
        emotional quotient, is a form of measurement to measure how high someones emotional intelligence is. Emotional
        intelligence is different to IQ in that 1. it is not a form of measurement and that 2. Emotional intelligence is
        the ability or find, perceive and control the emotions of oneself and others, compared to IQ which accesses the
        ability for one to apply logical understanding and reasoning, as well as understand abstract concepts and
        patterns.
      </p>
      <p class="head">Why is emotional intelligence important?</p>
      <p class="par">
        Emotional intelligence is important for many reasons. Probably one of, or the most important reason is that
        having high emotional intelligence increases happiness. Being able to understand, change and control one's
        feeling allows one to manage bad emotions more easily and increase positive emotions. Another important reason
        for having high emotional intelligence. Is with managing and working for other people. Being able to understand
        other people, with their needs and emotions, allows someone to lead people under them to their best strengths
        while mitigating their weaknesses. Being able to understand and control other peoples emotions also allows
        someone to manipulate them to get what they want, but this is more of a sociopathic view to high emotional
        intelligence. One more reason for having high emotional intelligence is it allows someone to be more productive.
        By managing one's thoughts and emotions such as mitigating or understanding bad emotions, one can manipulate
        them in a way to be able to do more things and be confident.
